1. Install docker desktop + docker-compose CLI
2. Run the following command:

docker-compose up -d

This will create two containers: a persistent volume for each database service, install postgres image, and expose
the database services in different ports.

 FLIGHT SERVICE'S DATABASE
    Name: hpel_july_2022
    Container name: hpel_july_2022
    Exposed port: 5433
    API User: root
    API Password: root

3. Connect to db_flight database using the previous credentials through your favorite SQL client.
